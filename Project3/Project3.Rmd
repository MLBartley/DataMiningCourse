#Introduction

This is Project 3 for STAT 557 2018 Spring by Meridith Bartley and Fei Jiang. The aim of this project is to implement a tree structured classifier using the splitting method in CART and a chosen split stopping criterion and then apply this classifier to a data set. 

#Description of Data

This car evaluation dataset is developed by Marko Bohanec and Blaz Zupan (1997). The response variable is the condition of a car which has two classes: unacceptable and acceptable. There are six predictors to develop the model: buying price, price of the maintenance, number of doors, capacity in terms of persons to carry, the size of luggage boot, and estomated safety of the car. #https://rpubs.com/minma/cart_with_rpart#
