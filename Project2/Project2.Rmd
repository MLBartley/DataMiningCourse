#Introduction

This is Project 2 for STAT 557 2018 Spring by Meridith Bartley and Fei Jiang. The aim of this project is topractice the k-means algorithm and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In this project we applied {METHOD} to {WHAT TYPE} data in order to {ACHEIVE WHAT}. 

#Description of Data

The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 70 elements each, randomly selected for the experiment. High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin.

                mutate(remove = NULL, 
                      type =  c(rep("kama", 70), rep("rosa", 70),
             
                                                  rep("canadian", 70)))

```

## Exploritory Data Analysis

```{r EDA - Mer, echo=FALSE, message = F, results = 'hide', fig.keep='all', fig.width = 8}

varlist <- names(project2data)[-8]

customPlot <- function(varName) {

project2data %>% 
group_by_("type") %>% 
select_("type",varName) %>% 
ggplot(aes_string("type",varName)) + geom_boxplot() + 
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

}

grid.arrange(grobs = lapply(varlist[1:4],customPlot))
grid.arrange(grobs = lapply(varlist[5:7],customPlot), ncol = 2)
